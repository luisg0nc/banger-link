This is a Telegram bot that helps you find YouTube links for music from Apple Music and Spotify. Simply send a link to a song from either service, and the bot will find a YouTube link for the same song.
It also allows users to request to extract the audio from the youtube link, uploaded as a file in the chat. ðŸ’ƒ

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Libraries:
  - `beautifulsoup4`: A library for parsing HTML and XML documents.
  - `python-telegram-bot`: A library for building Telegram bots.
  - `requests`: A library for making HTTP requests.
  - `pytube`: Library to interface with youtube, necessary to extract audio.
- API keys:
  - Telegram Bot
  - Youtube

## Running the bot

To run the bot, you'll need to set the `API_KEY` environment variable to your Telegram API key, as well as your Youtube API key. You can then run the `bot.py` script to start the bot.

## Docker

You can also run the provided docker-compose to easily launch it on docker. Just fill the API keys on the docker-compose:

```
    environment:
      YOUTUBE_API_KEY: your_youtube_api_key
      TELEGRAM_API_KEY: your_telegram_api_key
```

To build and run the Docker container, run the following command:

```
docker-compose build && \
docker-compose up -d
```

This will build the Docker image and run the container in detached mode.

## How to use

1. Add the bot to a group chat or talk directly to it.
2. Send a link to a song from Apple Music or Spotify
3. The bot will send back a YouTube link for the same song
   1. User may click Download
   2. Bot will download audio from youtube and upload to chat

Thanks to everyone who has worked on these two libraries, they are amazing! ðŸ˜Ž
